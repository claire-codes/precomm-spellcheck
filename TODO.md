* Bonus: only check modified lines
* Finally, use as git hook instead of package.json
* Remove hardcoded hook.sh filename?

Done
* Check it's OK with directories - it is
* Pass in multiple typos to check
* How do you exclude the instance of the typo in the shell file or package.json?
* Or add to list and carry on looking
* Open only modified files in directory: need to exclude deleted ones somehow
* Read file contents
* Search for string in file contents
* Die if it's found straight away
